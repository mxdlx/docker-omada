# TP-Link Omada Docker Container
Work in progress. This image only allows configuring HTTP and HTTPS ports for Omada Controller. Next step is to perform configuration backup and restore directly to MongoDB internal instance with [MGOB](https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanprodan/mgob/) since Omada is still a crappy application.

* [macexx version](https://github.com/macexx/EAP-Controller)
